## :three: About Mympy Dreams

Mympy Dreams is a marketplace where individuals can create a profile, post their VR project idea(DREAMS), define their needs/goals, and receive funding from the Mympy Dreams community.


### Key Features

Dreamers(users) can:

- Create a project(Dream) that describes their project. With each dream, dreamers can:
    * Share their story.
    * Receive funding, after setting fiscal goal.
    * Create journal entries to update donors.
    * Have an email list.
- Donate to other projects.
- Become a mentor.

## :four: Tech Stack

**Front end deployed to [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1dd77115-62b5-421c-af16-aab2a0ed6de9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mympydreamers/deploys)**

### Frontend built using:

#### React + Redux

React alone doesn't have efficient data flow (since you must pass down the data locally, which gets incredibly complicated if you have different branched child components). Redux solves this issue by having one store, which stores all the different states needed for the entire application. Then any component from the app can just connect to the store, pulling the data and avoiding multi-level data flow from parent components, avoiding data tracking mistakes, which in turn increases the productivity of the developers. 

Overall, the integration of React + Redux allows for the app to be scalable, efficient, and clean.


### Other Libraries:

#### Axios

Axios is used to preform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) requests to our backend. Our app, in turn, receives responses from our backend that subsequently renders such data in the related components.

#### ReactStrap

Using ReactStrap allows us to be more structural, organizational, and clean in design. It also boosts functional productivity, as we have more time researching on feature creation and less time on manual design creation.

#### Font Awesome

We use font awesome icons throughout the app for a clean, appealing design.

#### Slick Carousel

We use this library in order to create stunning carousel designs.

#### Jwt-decode

Used for decoding tokens received from the backend.

### [Back end](https://mympy-dreamers.herokuapp.com/) built using:

#### Node.js

We chose this because...

-    NodeJs and express are relatively simple to implement compared to Java          which is more verbose.

-    Some of the advantages of a java back-end aren't noticeable in a smaller        application such as Mympy.

#### PostgreSQL

-   We chose this over SQLite3 due to the limitations of SQLite3 and how it         interacts with Heroku.

#### Express

- It is used for easier creation of web applications and services.
- Consistent routing to modules.
- Consistent, customizable middleware interface.
- Handling post data, session management, static file serving, etc.

#### BCrypt.js

- Library for securing passwords 

## :five: APIs

### Auth0

-   Authentication limits access to only authorized users.
-   We chose Auth0 because it works better with payment api's and is      more integrated in the app then passport.   

### Stripe

-   Receiving payments and possibly keeping money in escrow.
-   we chose stripe because we wanted an api that was easy to learn       and works with payments, and stripe can accomplish that for us.

### Cloudinary

-   Cloudinary allows users to add pictures to user profiles and          Dream profiles.
-   Cloudinary is a popular and well supported API for storing and        retrieving photos. 

### SendGrid

-   emails, for payments and interactions

## :six: Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:


    * REACT_APP_BE_URL - holds the value of our Backend url used in our `actions` folder.
    * PROD_TOKEN - holds the token to the Mixpanel production tracker
    * DEV_TOKEN - holds the token to the MixPanel development token
