### About Mympy Dreamers

Mympy Dreams is a marketplace where individuals can create a profile and post their project and needs and find funding from the Mymphy Dreams community.


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features

-    feature one
-    feature two
-    feature three
-    feature four
-    feature five

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React.js

We chose this because...

-    Faster loading times.
-    Most of team knows React

Other Libraries

#### Redux

-   React can be complicated, Redux can help mitigate some of this issue.

#### Axios

-   Most Members know Axios as a way to handle promises

#### ReactStrap

-   Quick and easy reusable components
-   Using Bootstrap and Reacstrap to implement forms and search bars can save       time on simple yet sometimes time consuming engineering tasks.
-   Using SCSS everywhere else allows us to design everything else in a             completely custom manner.

#### Formidable Victory

-   Formidable's Victory is open source and aesthetically pleasing. 

##### Front end deployed to [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1dd77115-62b5-421c-af16-aab2a0ed6de9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mympydreamers/deploys)

### [Back end](https://mympy-dreamers.herokuapp.com/) built using:

#### Node.js

We chose this because...

-    NodeJs and express are relatively simple to implement compared to Java          which is more verbose.

-    Some of the advantages of a java back-end aren't noticeable in a smaller        application such as Mympy.

#### PostgreSQL

-   We chose this over SQLite3 due to the limitations of SQLite3 and how it         interacts with Heroku.

#### Express

-   

#### BCrypt.js

-   Library for securing passwords 

# APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Auth0

-   Authentication limits access to only authorized users.
-   We chose Auth0 because it works better with payment api's and is      more integrated in the app then passport.   

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Stripe

-   Receiving payments and possibly keeping money in escrow.
-   we chose stripe because we wanted an api that was easy to learn       and works with payments, and stripe can accomplish that for us.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cloudinary

-   Cloudinary allows users to add pictures to user profiles and          Dream profiles.
-   Cloudinary is a popular and well supported API for storing and        retrieving photos. 

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ SendGrid

-   emails, for payments and interactions

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:


    * REACT_APP_BE_URL - holds the value of our Backend url used in our `actions` folder.
    * PROD_TOKEN - holds the token to the Mixpanel production tracker
    * DEV_TOKEN - holds the token to the MixPanel development token
